# Seattle weather project

This project explores and compares rainfall patterns between Seattle, Washington and Miami, Florida using real weather data. While Seattle is often known for its frequent drizzle and cloudy days, Miami experiences tropical rainstorms and a humid climate. Using data science methods, this project analyzes precipitation trends to determine which city actually receives more rain and how rainfall varies throughout the year. Visualizations and statistical tests are used to support the findings and provide insights into each city’s unique weather characteristics.

## Analysis


Compare mean precipitation values averaged over all days

Precipitation by month

Add the column to the dataframe with the number of the month

Plot the distribution of precipitation amounts each month using boxplots

Plot the mean precipitation each month

Computing the mean precipitation each month

Plot the proportion of days with any precipitation

Add a variable to the dataframe that indicates whether there was any precipitation

Plot the proportion of days with any precipitation over the 5 years

Plot the proportion of days with precipitation each month

Plot the mean precipitation each month with a star for significant differences

Performing a statistical test for differences in the proportion of days with any precipitation each month between the cities

Plot the proportion of days with any precipitation each month with a star for significant differences

## Results

The result shows clear seasonal differences between the two cities. Seattle experiences rain more frequently throughout most of the year, especially during the fall and winter months (October–March). Miami, on the other hand, receives less frequent rain overall but has a noticeable increase during the summer months (June–September) due to its tropical climate and hurricane season.Overall, Seattle has more rainy days, while Miami tends to have heavier rainfall concentrated in fewer months.
